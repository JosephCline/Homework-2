location/folder as your assignment #1 clientserver.html file.
2. Add the code necessary to make the page HTML 5 compliant, i.e. DocType, head section (the
three meta tags, link tag, title tag within it), body section, open/close htmlf, etc. You
can use the template page/code from Assignment #1.
Use the following text as your title tag: Domain Names and Web Hosting

Based on this content (Domain Names and Web Hosting), create appropriate keywords and
description meta tags.
Semantic HTML
New semantic HTML tags were added to HTML in HTML 5 for page structure and layout.
Semantics is the study of the meanings of words and phrases in language. Semantic elements
are elements with a meaning. A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the
browser and the developer. Non-semantic elements such as div and span tell us nothing
about content. Semantic elements such as header and nav and more clearly describe their
content. Using the emphasis em tag over italics i is another example. Using semantic tags
allows web agents such as search engines, automated processors of documents, and other
software to ascertain the purpose and significance of the web page content/text.
